# 🌙 Moon7 Libraries

Welcome to the Moon7 ecosystem - a collection of lightweight, type-safe libraries for TypeScript and JavaScript that help you build better applications.

## 💫 What is Moon7?

Moon7 is a family of small, focused libraries designed to solve common programming challenges in modern web and application development. Each library addresses a specific problem domain with minimal overhead, allowing you to pick exactly what you need without bloating your project.

Our philosophy is simple:
- **Lightweight**: Small bundles with zero or minimal dependencies
- **Type-safe**: First-class TypeScript support with excellent type inference
- **Pragmatic**: Designed for real-world use in everyday applications
- **Flexible**: Using the right programming paradigm for each problem
